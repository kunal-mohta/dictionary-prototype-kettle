# Component Options

| Option                      | Type        | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `dbOptions`                 | `{Object}`  | The options to use when creating this database.  See [the PouchDB documentation](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#create_database) for supported options. |
| `dbOptions.name` (required) | `{String}`  | The name of the database. |


# Component Invokers

# `{that}.allDocs([options])`
* `options {Object}`: The options to control which records are returned.
* Returns: A `Promise` that will be resolved once the database has been initialized.

Return the full list of documents in the database, optionally filtered using `options`.

Check the [Pouchdb `allDocs` documentation](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#batch_fetch) for more details.


## `{that}.bulkDocs(docs, [options])`

Create or update multiple documents at once.  You will need to have valid `_id` and `_rev` values for each existing
document you wish to update.

Check the [PouchDB `bulkDocs` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#batch_create) for more details.


## `{that}.bulkGet(options)`

Retrieve a set of full documents based on `options` like the following:

```
{
    docs: [ {_id: "foo"}, {_id: "bar", _rev: "12345" }]
}
```

Check the [PouchDB `bulkGet` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#bulk_get) for more details.

## `{that}.close([options])`

Close the database.  Returns a promise that will be completed when the database is closed.  Also fires the
`onCloseComplete` event when the database is closed.

Check the [PouchDB `close` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#close_database) for more details.

## `{that}.destroyPouch()`

Destroy the database, including all records.  This is called `destroyPouch` to avoid overriding the implicit `destroy`
invoker that is part of [the Fluid component lifecycle](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ComponentLifecycle.html).

Check the [PouchDB `destroy` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#destroy) for more details.

## `{that}.compact([options])`

Compact the database, removing deleted data and older revisions.  This method is not tested and is used at your own
risk.

Check the [PouchDB `compact` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#compaction) for more details.

## `{that}.get(docId, [options])`

Retrieve the document whose ID matches `docId`.

Check the [PouchDB `get` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#fetch_document) for more details.


## `{that}.getAttachment(docId, attachmentId, [options])`

Retrieve an attachment from `docId` whose id matches `attachmentId`.  This method is not tested and is used at your own
risk.

Check the [PouchDB `getAttachment` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#get_attachment) for more details.


## `{that}.info()`

Get information about the current database, including the number of records.

Check the [PouchDB `info` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#database_information) for more details.


## `{that}.post(doc, [options])`

POST a new document `doc`. This may (but does not have to) contain an `_id` variable.

## `{that}.put(doc, [docId], [docRev], [options])`

PUT a new document or an update to an existing document.

Check the [PouchDB `put` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#create_document) for more details.


## `{that}.putAttachment(docId, attachmentId, [rev], attachment, type)`

Create or update an attachment.

Check the [PouchDB `putAttachment` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#save_attachment) for more details.  This method is
not tested and is used at your own risk.


## `{that}.query(fun, [options])`

Execute the supplied `fun` function and return the results.  Intended to be used with a map/reduce function.

Check the [PouchDB `query` docs](https://pouchdb.com/api.html#query_database) for more details.


## `{that}.remove(doc, [options])`

Remove the document `doc` from the database.  `doc` must contain a valid `_id` and `_rev`.

## Component Options

| Option               | Type        | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `baseDir`            | `{String}`  | The path in which our database content will live.  Will be used to populate  `options.dbOptions.prefix` (see below).  Defaults to a subdirectory based on the component's id in `os.tmpDir()`. |
| `dbOptions.prefix`   | `{String}`  | `baseDir`, and `dbOptions.name` (see above), combined into a final path, with a trailing separator. |
| `removeDirOnCleanup` | `{Boolean}` | Whether to remove `options.baseDir` during our "cleanup" phase.  Defaults to `true`. |
| `rimrafTimeout`      | `{Number}`  | When cleaning up filesystem content, the number of milliseconds to wait before forcing a timeout.  Defaults to `1000` (one second). |


## Component Invokers

### `{that}.loadData(dbPaths)`
* `dbPaths {String|Array}`: One or more package-relative paths to a JSON file to be loaded.
* Returns: A `Promise` that will be resolved once the data has been loaded.

Load one or more JSON files into this pouch instance.  There are two supported JSON file formats.  The first is simply
an array of records, as in the following example:

```
[{ "name": "apple", "color": "red"}, { "name": "banana", "color": "yellow" }]
```

The second format is the same as used with [the CouchDB bulk document API](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Bulk_Document_API#Modify_Multiple_Documents_With_a_Single_Request):

```
{
  "docs": [ { "_id": "myId", "foo": "bar"} ]
}
```

In both formats, an `_id` variable is optional, but if supplied, the value must be unique across all of the supplied
data files.
